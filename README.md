Vim Corpus
==========

A Vim plugin for editing text corpus (essays, notes, papers, markdown, etc).
This is *not* a replacement for a word processor, but rather a collection of Vim
settings to make writing easier.

This plugin is still in its early phases, more will be added.

## Installation

1. With Pathogen: Place `vim-corpus/` in `.vim/bundle/`.

## Usage
Pressing <Leader>e will put the current buffer in corpus mode. To show the word
(and other stats) count, press <Leader>w.
